# About

Hey there, my name is Nicolas.

I'm a full-stack software developer proficient in PHP, JS, MySQL, HTML, and CSS.
I'm currently preparing a career transition away from the WordPress ecosystem.
I'm tinkering a lot with agentic engineering and AI-native software development.
I use Arch btw, LOL.

Have fun on my blog!
