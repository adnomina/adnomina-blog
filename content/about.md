# About

Hey there, my name is Nicolas.

I'm a full-stack software developer and I've been in the business since 2019. I'm currently working with WordPress sites, which means I'm doing a lot of PHP in the backend and JavaScript/jQuery in the frontend, but I'm preparing a career transition towards the JavaScript environment.

I'm also currently tinkering a lot with agentic engineering or AI-native software development, however you might call it, and learning a lot of new things every day about coding agents.

Oh, and I use Arch btw, LOL.

Anyway, on this blog I'm planning to write about my experience and lessons that I've learned as a web developer.

Have fun looking around!
